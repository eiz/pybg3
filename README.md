# pybg3

pybg3 is a python extension library which provides access to Baldur's Gate 3
game data. The ultimate goal of this library is to provide the basis for an
OpenUSD-based content pipeline which enables creation of custom maps and
cinematics in BG3.

Currently, the library is not ready for production. There is no documentation
and most functionality is incomplete or not yet started.
